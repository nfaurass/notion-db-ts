## Limitations

While **notion-db-ts** streamlines your workflow with Notion, there are a few important considerations:
- **Rate Limits:** Notion’s API has rate limits, so be mindful of how many requests your application sends.
- **Complex Queries:** Notion is not a traditional relational database. Basic queries are simple, but complex relational queries might be limited.
- **API Latency:** Performance depends on Notion’s API response times, which may not match those of conventional databases.
